# macOS Profile Picture Extractor

I've grown to quite like Apple's Memoji feature, and have started using my Memoji as my profile picture on basically every website that lets you set one. 



This script is a wrapper around a command provided by John Galt on the [Apple Community forums](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8027172?sortBy=best). 




## Usage

Clone the repo (or just download the script file) and run it on the command line as the user you wish to extract the profile picture for. 

## Alternatives

You can also convert your Memoji to a .PNG file with a transparent background by sending yourself a Memoji sticker using iMessage. However, there are some 'poses' that are available in the macOS Memoji editor that are not available as stickers in iMessage:
